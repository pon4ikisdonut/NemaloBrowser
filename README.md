## Branching Strategy

This project uses a simple Git branching model:

*   **`dev`**: This is the primary development branch. All new features, bug fixes, and unstable builds are pushed here. This is the "bleeding edge" version of the browser.
*   **`main`**: This branch is reserved for stable, tested releases. Code from the `dev` branch is merged into `main` when it's considered ready for a release.
